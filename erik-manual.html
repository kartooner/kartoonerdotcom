                <p>We design workforce management tools that make people's lives easier. Our users deal with constantly

                    complexity with confidence.</p>
                <p>We do that by staying close to the problems, moving fast, and building tools that solve real needs,
                    not imagined ones.</p>
                <p><strong>The bigger goal? Do work you're proud of. Keep leveling up.</strong></p>

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Great work comes from the people closest to the problem.</h3>
                    <p>You're in the day-to-day. You're hearing the nuances. You're seeing the patterns. That proximity
                        matters more than any vision I could hand down from a distance.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Trust moves faster than perfection.</h3>
                    <p>When we trust each other, we move quickly, adjust without fear, and focus on outcomes instead of
                        process. Hesitation is what slows us down.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Independence beats dependency.</h3>
                    <p>My job is to help you grow your own judgment and decision-making, not to become the bottleneck
                        for every decision you need to make.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Design is a team sport.</h3>
                    <p>The best solutions come from working with POs, Dev, Arch, and each other. We're partners solving
                        shared problems, not gatekeepers protecting a process.</p>

            <h2>How I show up as a Lead</h2>

            <h3>I'm your second brain, not your enabler.</h3>
            <p>I help you think through problems, unblock decisions, and clear dynamics. I'm not here to think for you
                or decide for you.</p>

            <h3>Invite me in.</h3>
            <p>I'm available when you need me. Pull me in when you're stuck, when there's a dynamic to navigate, when
                you want a gut check. Tell me when you need space to think, and we'll reconnect when you're ready.</p>

            <h3>I care about great collaboration and clear thinking.</h3>
            <p>I don't tell you what to design. I create the conditions where you can do your best work. That means
                setting expectations for how we work together, clearing organizational noise, and making sure the right
                people are in the room at the right time.</p>

            <h3>I default to trust.</h3>
            <p>I assume you're capable, thoughtful, and making good decisions with what you know. If I have concerns,
                I'll tell you directly. My starting position is always trust. That trust is maintained by how we show up
                for each other and the work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What I expect from you</h2>

            <h3>Own your decisions.</h3>
            <p>You're in the work every day. You have context I don't. Make the call, move forward. If it doesn't work
                out, that's information. We adjust.</p>

            <h3>Be open early.</h3>
            <p>Rough sketches, messy Miro boards, half-formed ideas. Don't wait for polish to share. The earlier we
                talk, the faster we learn.</p>

            <h3>Ask "what are we learning here?" before "is this polished enough?"</h3>
            <p>Progress matters more than perfection. We can always polish later. The question is: are we learning what
                we need to know to move forward?</p>

            <h3>Pull in the right people sooner rather than later.</h3>
            <p>If Arch needs to weigh in, bring them in early. If Dev has context that matters, loop them in. If your PO
                can help clarify something, ask. Don't wait for the "right moment." The right moment is now.</p>

            <h3>Surface problems before you have solutions.</h3>
            <p>If something's not working (a process, a dynamic, something I said or did), tell me. If you're
                struggling, say so. If you disagree with a direction, speak up. I'd rather know than guess. And if you
                need more from me (or less), just say so.</p>

            <h3>Do work you're proud of.</h3>
            <p>That's the bar. Not perfect work. Not work that makes everyone happy. Work that you can stand behind.
                Work that solves real problems for real people.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How we work together</h2>

            <h3>Dual-track methodology.</h3>
            <p>Discovery and delivery run at the same time. We don't wait until we know everything before we start
                building. We let both tracks move forward together, checking in, sharing what we're seeing, adjusting as
                we go.</p>

            <h3>Progress over perfection.</h3>
            <p>We make the best call we can with what we know, then we keep learning. If something doesn't land the way
                we hoped, that's not failure. That's information.</p>

            <h3>Trust over fear.</h3>
            <p>When we trust each other, changing direction isn't scary. It's just part of the work.</p>

            <h3>UX as partner, not gatekeeper.</h3>
            <p>We're not here to be the design police. We're here to solve problems together. That means being in it
                with Product, Dev, and Arch from the start, not showing up at the end to approve or reject.</p>

            <p>I'd rather hear what you actually think than a carefully worded version of what you think I want to hear.
                Be direct. Be real.</p>

            <h3>I think in frameworks and systems.</h3>
            <p>If I'm asking a lot of questions, it's not because I doubt you. It's because I'm trying to understand the
                system we're working in so I can help you navigate it. My feedback and questions are meant to help you
                see connections and think strategically, not to question your ability.</p>

            <h3>I use metaphors a lot.</h3>
            <p>Vampires. Second brains. Overclocked humans. Burgers. If it helps make something clear, I'll reach for
                it. Call me out if a metaphor isn't landing.</p>

            <h3>I care about energy management.</h3>
            <p>Both yours and mine. If you're burned out, tell me. If I'm asking too much, say so. Sustainable work
                matters more than short-term heroics.</p>

            <h3>I'm a reader, a drawer, and a movie person.</h3>
            <p>I grew up on 80s and 90s cartoons, Back to the Future, Jurassic Park, TMNT. I still love classic cinema
                and I'm constantly watching something. Pop culture is a language I speak fluently, so if you want to
                talk about movies, games, or what you're reading, I'm here for it.</p>

            <h3>I draw for fun.</h3>
            <p>It's how I think sometimes. If you see me sketching in a meeting, I'm not checked out. I'm processing.
            </p>

            <h3>I care about the non-linear path.</h3>
            <p>I've been a janitor, a ride operator, a graphics editor, and now a design lead. The path wasn't straight,
                and I don't expect yours to be either. What matters is where you're headed and how you're growing, not
                how you got here.</p>

            <h3>I maintain chickens.</h3>
            <p>They're ridiculous and delightful. If you ever want to hear about chicken drama, just ask.</p>

                will not be defensive. I will adjust. I'd rather fix things early than find out later that I was in the
