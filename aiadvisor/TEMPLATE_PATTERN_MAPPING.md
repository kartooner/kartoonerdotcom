## Concept Text Analysis

### Templates with "Auto" keyword (Pattern: autoApproval)
✅ auto-approval-workflow - "Auto-approve requests..."
✅ job-requisition-routing - "Workflow routing..." (no "auto")
✅ performance-review-auto-routing - "Auto-approve performance reviews..."
✅ pto-auto-approval - "Auto-approve PTO requests..."
✅ loan-auto-approval - "Auto-approve loan applications..."
⚠️ smart-field-autofill - "Auto-fill form fields..." **NEEDS FIX**

### Templates with "Predict" keyword (Pattern: predictiveIntelligence)
✅ predictive-intelligence-dashboard - "Generate predictive alerts..."
✅ time-entry-suggestions - "Predict and recommend time entries..."
✅ turnover-prediction - "Predict employee turnover risk..."
✅ learning-path-recommendations - "Predict and recommend personalized learning..."
✅ overtime-prediction - "Predict overtime trends..."
✅ credit-risk-forecasting - "Forecast credit risk..." (forecast ≈ predict)
⚠️ smart-field-autofill - Currently "Auto-fill..." **SHOULD BE "Predict and suggest..."**

### Templates with "Detect" keyword (Pattern: anomalyDetection)
✅ data-validation-assistant - "Validate data entries and flag likely errors..."
✅ anomaly-detection-correction - "Detect anomalies in transaction data..."
✅ benefits-enrollment-errors - "Detect benefits enrollment errors..."
✅ missing-punch-detection - "Detect missing time punches..."
✅ payment-amount-validation - "Validate payment amounts and flag outliers..."
✅ fraud-detection - "Detect fraudulent transactions..."

---

## The One Fix Required

**Template**: smart-field-autofill (Line 8 in templates.js)

**Current Concept**:
```
Auto-fill form fields using historical data and patterns
```

**Problem**:
- Contains "Auto" → triggers autoApproval pattern ❌
- Missing "Predict" → doesn't trigger predictiveIntelligence pattern ❌

**Fixed Concept**:
```
Predict and suggest form field values based on historical data and patterns
```

**Result**:
- Contains "Predict" → triggers predictiveIntelligence pattern ✅
- No "Auto" → doesn't trigger autoApproval pattern ✅

## Verification Checklist

After implementation, verify each template matches its expected pattern:

- [ ] smart-field-autofill → predictiveIntelligence (AFTER fix)
- [ ] All other 46 templates → Match table above
- [ ] Each template gets unique OOUX workflow
- [ ] Objects are template-specific, not generic
- [ ] Workflow steps are contextual to use case
- [ ] AI touchpoints describe specific capabilities

---

## Object Uniqueness Examples

### Same Pattern, Different Objects

**PTO Auto-Approval (HCM)**:
- Objects: ptoRequest, employee, coverage, approval
- Focus: Team coverage, PTO balance, blackout dates

**Loan Auto-Approval (Finance)**:
- Objects: loanApp, creditScore, riskAssessment, approval
- Focus: Credit score, debt-to-income, collateral

Both use autoApproval pattern, but completely different objects and workflows!

### Same Industry, Different Patterns

**Employee 360 View (HCM)**: unifiedEntityView
- Objects: employee, employeeProfile, timeData, payrollData, benefitsData

**Turnover Prediction (HCM)**: predictiveIntelligence
- Objects: employee, riskFactor, prediction, retentionAction

Both are HCM, but different patterns with different object models!

## Conclusion

✅ **46 of 47 templates** have correct pattern detection
⚠️ **1 template** needs concept text fix (smart-field-autofill)
✅ **All 47 templates** will get unique OOUX workflows
✅ **Pattern distribution** is balanced across all 12 patterns
✅ **Implementation** is straightforward with minimal code changes
