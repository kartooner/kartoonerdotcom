- Always run a local server using Node.
- Use sentence casing on UI labels where it makes sense.
- Update build scripts when we make navigation changes.
- journal-entries.json exists in the root.
- Blog stories are located in `/stories/` directory (not `/scripts/stories/`).
- Local server should handle clean URLs so you can navigate to /journal, /voice-acting, /contact, etc. without needing the .html extension.
